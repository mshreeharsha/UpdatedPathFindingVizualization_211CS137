Path Finder Vizualization


This Repo is of a Path Finding Algorithm that finds the SHORTEST PATH between 2 points i.e.. starting and ending points using A* Algorithm.
The user is provided the choice to add obstacles and mention the size of the grid.
The Algorithm finds the path in between the obstacles and displayes the message when it is found and is highlighted.
There are 2 Buttons one to Start the Algorithm and other to reset the grid.
